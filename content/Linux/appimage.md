# AppImage

Download an application, make it executable, and run! No need to install. No system libraries or system preferences are altered. Can also run in a sandbox like [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail)



# Usage

To run an AppImage, simply:

Make it executable

```
$ chmod a+x Subsurface*.AppImage
```

and run!

```
$ ./Subsurface*.AppImage
```

That was easy, wasn't it?
