# Installation



## Anaconda

We **strongly recommend** installing Python and Jupyter using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

First, download Anaconda We recommend downloading Anaconda’s latest Python 3 version.



Mac OSX

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg

Linux 

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```
jupyter notebook
```



## pip

As an existing or experienced Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Python’s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

If you have Python 3 installed (which is recommended):

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

If you have Python 2 installed:

```
