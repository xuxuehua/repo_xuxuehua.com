# 人生的意义

但做好事，莫问前程

以无生之觉悟，为有生之事业。



## 除了死，剩下的都是擦伤。





# 道德谴责

当我们在进行道德谴责的时候，一定不要把自己排除在道德判断之外。

如果总是盯着别人的黑暗而无视自己内心的幽暗，有一天，你的影子是会吞掉你的。



# Coronavirus

暂时不买房





# Love and Hate

"Passion is for the greedy, purpose is for the people"  

"If you want to do what you love, you have to learn first what you hate"







# 复杂体系 vs 简单体系

KPI是简单体系，员工行为是复杂体系



## 工作的生物态 vs 工作的机械态

员工的想法，成长，责任



## 在混乱中成长

一切KPI都是错误的KPI，只要你要让对方知道





# Five hindrances to self-mastery



## Sensual desire

Sensual desire is intertwined pleasure, and it arises when we have a deep craving for something that stimulates one or more of our five senses (vision, hearing, smell, touch and taste). 

Imagine you’ve been spending the past week practicing for a half-marathon. But on the second week, you are interrupted by a smartphone begging for your attention.

You give in and end up scrolling through your social media feeds for hours. The time you had set aside for practicing are now wasted. You’ve lost track.

Sensual desires aren’t always bad. The idea is that any desire (healthy or unhealthy) can easily turn into an obsession or addiction that distracts us from our goals.



**Practice overcoming self desire**: The only way to truly fight a temptation is to think deeply and carefully about the eventual consequences of succumbing to it. The next time a sensual desire emerges, ask yourself: *Will this help or hurt me in the long run? In what ways?*





## Ill will

Ill will is the opposite of sensual desire. It’s the mental state of *not wanting* something, because of a strong dislike or rejection towards it. It might involve an activity, situation or person.

In order to repair a relationship with a friend, for example, you need to sit down and talk about the issues affecting your relationship. But since you hate confrontations, even non-aggressive ones, you avoid having a conversation altogether. And you might continue to do the same with other relationships, too.

Negative emotions (e.g., fear, anger, frustration) are a natural part of life. But dwelling on them prevents us from moving forward; we just stay stuck in that emotional state.

**Practice overcoming ill will**: Instead of ignoring your ill wills, investigate the roots of it. If you dislike confrontations, ask yourself *why*. Maybe it’s because you’ve never had success finding solutions to conflicts. Think back to past experiences: What went wrong? What could have been done differently?

See this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself by letting go of old ways and trying new ones.





## Sloth and torpor

A state of inaction leads to sloth and torpor. It’s a result of having low energy and a lack of motivation. Sloth and torpor can also come in the form of defeat, self-pity, thoughts of futility, complacency or even depression.

Maybe you’re experiencing it in your career, because you feel unmotivated by the work you do, or you don’t think you’re good enough.

In Buddhism, it is often described as imprisonment. The more you allow it to control your mind and body, the faster the walls will close in on you. 

**Practice overcoming sloth and torpor**: As with all hindrances, you must identify what led you to this mental state. Then remind yourself of your goals and what inspired them in the first place. Start taking steps to push through the walls; they can be as small and simple as reaching out to a mentor or doing a walking meditation.



## Restlessness

Restlessness is the result of an unsettled mind. This often happens to people who are constantly worried or anxious about the future, or who judge themselves (or others) for their actions.

In Buddhism, restlessness is referred to as having a “monkey mind”: Constantly jumping from one branch to another, unable to stay focused.

During times of restlessness, we become more vulnerable to whims and may act in ways that we later regret, thus fueling the hindrance even more. 

**Practice overcoming restlessness**: Observe your restlessness *as* it is happening. Your mind might be stirring with frustration over something you regret doing the week before. Acknowledge that feeling, understand it, then let it go.

Meditation is one of the most effective ways to overcome restlessness. The point is to clear your mind of compulsive clutter, so that you can find peace and quiet in the present.



## Skeptical doubt

Skeptical doubt leads to uncontrollable hesitation and questioning. This hindrance can be likened to a tub of water stirred with mud, and placed in a dark room. The lack of light and cloudiness makes it hard to see clearly.

You might question your abilities (“Am I capable of doing this?” “What if I fail?”), or a mentor’s advice (“He’s not experienced enough.” “I know more than he does.”), or your decisions (“Am I doing the right thing?” What if something bad happens?”).

**Practice overcoming skeptical doubt**: Doubt can actually be your friend. It might exist as a sign that you need to take step back to reconsider your options, or it might indicate that something (e.g., a decision or given task) is a violation of your values.

The key is to challenge your doubts. Ask yourself: *Does the reasoning behind my doubt make sense? Is there logic to it? Or is it really just disconnecting me from my goals?*









At least one of these hindrances, if not ALL of these hindrances, will happen to you on your way up your mountain. So, what can we do to prevent them from happening?

Keyword: ***prevent\***.

The answer is a process, a 4-step system that he talks about at the end of his talk.

1. Analyze — what state am I in? If you don’t know what state you are in you can’t do anything about it.
2. Learn to accept, acknowledge, and **allow** the situation, person, or object to be exactly what it is. Let it be exactly how it is, and learn to accept it.
3. Investegate your mental state. What will happen if I let myself stay in this state? What got me into this state in the first place? Has this been a long time coming? What can I change to make this less likely to happen?
4. Lastly, you must non-identify. This sounds dark — but all that it means is something that’s common sense, and that you have to keep in mind.

For non-identifying you need to keep in mind:

> ***I am not my mind.\***
>
> ***I am not my body.\***
>
> ***I am not my emotions.\***

Because you’re not. You are a combination of all those things, and then a bunch more. So don’t let them control you, let you control them, work with them. They are tools at *your* disposal. So use them to master yourself, and therefore anything you want.
