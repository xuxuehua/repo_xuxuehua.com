Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m thrilled about the opportunity to apply for the SRE position at XXX. I have always had natural problem-solving skills, and working in OPS team is the good job for my skill set. 

Currently I worked as NOC Engineer position at ZZZ, I specialized in developing tools that simplify our complicated workflow, and over the 2.5 years employment, I received high ratings and scores in performance review each year.

I enjoy to learn the new technology and put them into effect at personal project or production env if it is possible. Recent months I started to sort all the knowledge I have learnt and put them together into my own website (www.XuXuehua.com), it is a good chance to review my knowlege and encourage me to learn something new.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my resume and cover letter. I’m looking forward to finding out more about this position at XXX. If you wish to learn more about my experience and skill set, please contact me at any time.

Sincerely,
Rick Xu
