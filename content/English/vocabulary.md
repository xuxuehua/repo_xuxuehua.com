## 词根词缀

## proactive

它的意思是“积极、主动的”，它的反义词是 reactive，“消极、被动的”。

The difference between proactive people and reactive people is that **proactive people take initiative**, and they come up with ideas to get things done despite the conditions they are in.

**Reactive people**, on the other hand, usually are the ones to **react to** a situation rather than take initiative to create a situation. 

翻译：积极主动的人和消极被动的人之间的区别在于，积极主动的人会采取主动，无论他们所处的环境如何，都会想出办法来完成任务；而消极被动型的人通常只会对形势做出被动的反应，而不会主动采取行动去创造形势。





## settle for / settle 

简单来说，settle for 就是“勉强同意接受，将就或者凑合”的意思。

He demanded a bigger raise but decided to settle for what they offered.

翻译：他原本要求更高的涨薪，但最后决定人家给多少拿多少，凑合一下算了。





同样，settle 这个动词有“停留、安顿”的含义，也可以衍生出“将就、凑合、妥协”的意思

And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.  **Don't settle**

. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking until you find it. 

**Don't settle**
