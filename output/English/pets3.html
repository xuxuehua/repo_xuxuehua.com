<ol>
<li>​    70.There is a growing tendency for parents to ask their children to accept extra educational programs over the recent years.</li>
</ol>

<p>\71. This phenomenon has caused wide public concern in many places of world.</p>
<p>这一现象在全世界许多地方已引起了广泛关注。</p>
<p>\72. Many parents believe that additional educational activities enjoy obvious advantage. By extra studies, they maintain, their children are able to obtain many kinds of practical skills and useful knowledge, which will put them in a beneficial position in the future job markets when they grow up.</p>
<p>许多家长相信额外的教育活动有许多优点，通过学习，他们的孩子可以获得很多实践技能和有用的知识，当他们长大后，这些对他们就业是大有好处的。</p>
<p>\73. In the first place, extra studies bring about unhealthy impacts on physical growth of children. Educational experts point out that, it is equally important to take some sport activities instead of extra studies when children have spent the whole day in a boring classroom.</p>
<p>首先，额外的学习对孩子们的身体发育是不利的。教育专家指出，孩子们在枯燥的教室里呆了一整天后，从事一些体育活动，而不是额外的学习，是非常重要的。</p>

<p>而且，由于要额外地学习，孩子们没有多少时间和同龄的孩子玩耍和交流，很难培养他们的个性和交际能力。他们可能变得孤僻甚至产生某些心理疾病。</p>
<p>\78. From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that, although extra studies indeed enjoy many obvious advantages, its disadvantages shouldn't be ignored and far outweigh its advantages. It is absurd to force children to take extra studies after school.</p>
<p>通过以上讨论，我们可以得出结论：尽管额外学习的确有很多优点，但它的缺点不可忽视，且远大于它的优点。因此，放学后强迫孩子额外学习是不明智的</p>
<p>\79. Any parents should place considerable emphasis on their children to keep the balance between play and study. As an old saying goes: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.</p>
<p>任何家长都应非常重视保持孩子学习与玩耍的平衡，正如那句老话：只工作，不玩耍，聪明的孩子会变傻</p>
<p>\80. There is a growing tendency for parent these days to stay at home to look after their children instead of returning to work earlier.</p>
<p>现在，父母亲留在家里照顾孩子而不愿过早返回工作岗位正成为增加的趋势。</p>
<p>\81. Parents are firmly convinced that, to send their child to kindergartens or nursery schools will have an unfavorable influence on the growth of children.</p>
<p>父母们坚定地相信把孩子送到幼儿园对他们的成长不利。</p>
<p>\82. However, this idea is now being questioned by more and more experts, who point out that it is unhealthy for children who always stay with their parents at home.</p>
<p>然而，这一想法正遭受越来越多的专家的质疑，他们指出，孩子总是呆在家里，和父母在一起，是不健康的</p>
<p>\83. Although parent would be able to devote much more time and energy to their children, it must be admitted that, parent has less experience and knowledge about how to educate and supervise children, when compared with professional teachers working in kindergartens or nursery schools</p>
<p>尽管父母能在他们孩子身上投入更多时间和精力，但是必须承认，与工作在幼儿园的专职教师相比，他们在如何管理教育孩子方面缺乏知识和经验</p>
<p>\84. From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw a conclusion that, although the parents' desire to look after children by themselves is understandable, its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages</p>
<p>通过以上讨论，我们可以得出结论：尽管家长想亲自照看孩子的愿望是可以理解的，但是这样做的缺点远大于优点</p>
<p>\85. Parents should be encouraged to send their children to nursery schools, which will bring about profound impacts on children and families, and even the society as a whole.</p>
<p>应该鼓励父母将他们的孩子送到幼儿园，这将对孩子，家庭，甚至整个社会产生深远的影响</p>
<p>\86. Many leaders of government always go into raptures at the mere mention of artistic and cultural projects. They are forever talking about the nice parks, the smart sculptures in central city and the art galleries with various valuable rarities. Nothing, they maintain, is more essential than such projects in the economic growth.</p>
<p>只要一提起艺术和文化项目，一些政府领导就会兴奋不已，他们滔滔不绝地说着美丽的公园，城市中心漂亮的雕塑，还有满是稀世珍宝的艺术展览馆。他们认为在经济发展中，没有什么比这些艺术项目更重要了</p>
<p>\87. But is it really the case? The information I've collected over last few years leads me to believe that artistic and cultural projects may be less useful than many governments think. In fact, basic infrastructure projects are playing extremely important role and should be given priority</p>
<p>这是真的吗？这些年我收集的信息让我相信这些文化、艺术项目并没有许多政府想象的那么重要。事实上，基础设施建设非常重要，应该放在首位</p>
<p>\88. Those who are in favor of artistic and cultural projects advocate that cultural environment will attract more tourists, which will bring huge profits to local residents. Some people even equate the build of such projects with the improving of economic construction</p>
<p>那些赞成建设文化艺术项目的人认为文化环境会吸引更多的游客，这将给当地居民带来巨大的利益。一些人甚至把建设文化艺术项目与发展经济建设等同起来</p>
<p>\89. Unfortunately, there is very few evidence that big companies are willing to invest a huge sums of money in a place without sufficient basic projects, such as supplies of electricity and water</p>
<p>然而，很少有证据表明大公司愿意把巨额的资金投到一个连水电这些基础设施都不完善的地方去</p>
<p>\90. From what has been discussed above, it would be reasonable to believe that basic projects play far more important role than artistic and cultural projects in people's life and economic growth</p>
<p>通过以上讨论，我们有理由相信在人们的生活和经济发展方面，基础建设比艺术文化项目发挥更大的作用</p>
<p>\91. Those urban planners who are blind to this point will pay a heavy price, which they cannot afford it</p>
<p>那些城市的规划者们如果忽视这一点，将会付出他们无法承受的代价</p>
<p>\92. There is a growing tendency these days for many people who live in rural areas to come into and work in city. This problem has caused wide public concern in most cities all over the world.</p>
<p>农民进城打工正成为增长的趋势，这一问题在世界上大部分城市已引起普遍关注</p>
<p>\93. An investigation shows that many emigrants think that working at city provide them with not only a higher salary but also the opportunity of learning new skills</p>
<p>一项调查显示许多民工认为在城市打工不仅有较高的收入，而且能学到一些新技术</p>
<p>\94. It must be noted that improvement in agriculture seems to not be able to catch up with the increase in population of rural areas and there are millions of peasants who still live a miserable life and have to face the dangers of exposure and starvation.</p>
<p>必须指出，农业的发展似乎赶不上农村人口的增加，并且仍有成千上万的农民过着缺衣挨饿的贫寒生活</p>
<p>\95. Although rural emigrants contribute greatly to the economic growth of the cities, they may inevitably bring about many negative impacts.</p>
<p>尽管民工对城市的经济发展做出了巨大贡献，然而他们也不可避免的带来了一些负面影响</p>
<p>\96. Many sociologists point out that rural emigrants are putting pressure on population control and social order; that they are threatening to take already scarce city jobs; and that they have worsened traffic and public health problems.</p>
<p>许多社会学家指出民工正给人口控制和社会治安带来压力。他们正在威胁着本已萧条的工作市场，他们恶化了交通和公共卫生状况。</p>
<p>\97. It is suggested that governments ought to make efforts to reduce the increasing gap between cities and countryside. They ought to set aside an appropriate fund for improvement of the standard of peasants' lives. They ought to invite some experts in agriculture to share their experiences, information and knowledge with peasants, which will contribute directly to the economic growth of rural areas.</p>
<p>建议政府应该努力减少正在拉大的城乡差距。应该划拨适当的资金提高农民的生活水平；应该邀请农业专家向农民介绍他们的经验，知识和信息，这些将有助于发展农村经济。</p>
<p>\98. In conclusion, we must take into account this problem rationally and place more emphases on peasants' lives. Any government that is blind to this point will pay a heavy price.</p>
<p>总之，我们应理智考虑这一问题，重视农民的生活。任何政府忽视这一点都将付出巨大的代价。</p>
<p>\99. Although many experts from universities and institutes consistently maintain that it is an inevitable part of an independent life, parents in growing numbers are starting to realize that people, including teachers and experts in education, should pay considerable attention to this problem.</p>
<p>尽管来自高校和研究院的许多专家坚持认为这是独立生活不可避免的一部分，然而越来越多的家长开始意识到包括教师和教育专家在内的人该认真对待这一问题。</p>
<ol>
<li>​    100.As for me, it is essential to know, at first, what kind of problems young students possible would encounter on campus.</li>
</ol>
<p>我认为，首先应看看学生们在校园可能遇到哪些问题</p>
<p>\101. In addition to the obvious problem--loneliness, another major obstacle, in my opinion, is the alien environment of campus.</p>
<p>除了孤独这一明显的问题之外，我认为另一个困难是对校园环境的不熟悉</p>
<p>\102. Freshmen often get lost on campus; fail to find the way to dormitory or library.</p>
<p>新生常常在校园迷路，不知道去宿舍或图书馆该怎么走</p>
<p>\103. Most important of all, apart from their hometown and parents, students couldn't catch sight of any familiar face and have to suffer from homelessness, which can cause certain serious mental disease.</p>
<p>更重要的是，离开了家乡和父母，看不到任何熟悉的面孔，他们不得不忍受思家之苦，这可能会导致严重的精神疾病。</p>
<p>\104. In the first place, school authorities should provide far more services to help freshmen to get used to the new life as soon as possible.</p>
<p>首先，学校应提供更多的服务，帮助新生尽快适应新的生活</p>

<p>总之，我们应重视这个问题，尽最大努力帮助他们平稳度过他们最初的校园生活</p>
<p>\108. There is a general discussion over fashion in recent years. One of the questions under debate is whether a person should choose comfortable clothes, which he or she likes, regardless of fashion.</p>
<p>近些年，关于时尚存在着广泛的争论。其中一个问题就是一个人是否应选择他喜欢的舒适的衣服，而不管是否时尚。</p>
<p>\109. This issue is becoming a matter of concern for more and more people, especially for parents and experts in education.</p>
<p>这一问题已被越来越多的人关注，尤其是父母和教育专家。</p>
<p>\110. Many young people always go into raptures at the merely mention of buying fashion clothes. And they seem to be attracted by colorful material, various styles of fashion clothes. There is nothing, they maintain, that can't be compared with fashion clothes. In fact, fashion clothes had become indispensable part of youngster's life.</p>
<p>许多年轻人一提到时尚服装就兴高采烈。他们似乎被时尚服装那多彩的面料，各种不同的款式所吸引。</p>
<p>\111. Many people seem to overlook the basic fact: the major function of clothing is to keep us warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>许多人似乎忽视了这个基本事实：衣服的基本功能是保持我们舒适和温暖。</p>
<p>\112. Furthermore, people who addict to fashion clothes have to spend more time going shopping and pay more attention to the impression they make on others. As a result, it is impossible to devote enough time and energy in their study and job.</p>
<p>而且，沉湎于时尚服装的人们不得不花费更多时间逛商店，更加注意自己给别人的印象。因此，他们不可能有足够的时间用于学习或工作。</p>
<p>\113. No one can doubt the essential fact that the traffic problem over the last years has caused wide public concern all over the world. Experts in increasing numbers are beginning to believe that such situation would produce unfavorable effects on economic growth of local areas.</p>
<p>没有人能否认这一重要事实：最近几年交通问题在全世界受到了普遍关注。越来越多的专家开始相信这种状况将对当地的经济发展产生不利影响。</p>
<p>\114. There are several reasons for this problem. One of the main reasons is that the number of vehicles is increasing much more rapidly than building of roads. Another primary reason is that there seem to be too many private cars and not enough public buses.</p>
<p>关于这个问题，有很多原因。一个主要原因是车辆增加的数量远快于道路的建设。另一个主要原因是私家车过多而公交车不够。</p>
<p>\115. Meanwhile, the numbers of people, who have access to their own cars, have risen sharply in the recent years.</p>
<p>同时，拥有私人轿车的人数这几年却在快速增加。</p>
<p>\116. Moreover, many people, including drivers and cyclists, do not obey the traffic rules properly, especially at busy intersections. And this undoubtedly worsens the already grave situation.</p>
<p>而且，许多人，包括司机和骑自行车的人，不能很好地遵守交通规则，特别是在繁忙的十字路口，这无疑使本已严重的状况雪上加霜。</p>
<p>\117. The number of private cars in urban areas should be limited while the number of public buses should be increased.</p>
<p>在城市私人轿车的数量应得到控制而公交车的数量应该增加。</p>
<p>\118. When asked what kind of school they are willing to send their children to attend, many parents say they would choose a boarding school rather than day schools for their children.</p>
<p>当问到愿意将孩子送到哪种学校的时候，许多父母认为他们会选择寄宿学校而不是日制学校。</p>
<p>\119. Many survey show that people in increasing numbers are beginning to recognize that boarding school provides better environment and facilities for children.</p>
<p>许多调查显示越来越多的人开始意识到寄宿学校能给他们的孩子提供较好的学习环境和设施。</p>
<p>\120. At the same time, there are still many people who live under the traditional ideas that day schools play an extremely important role in children's study.</p>
<p>同时，仍有许多人持传统观点认为日制学校对孩子的学习发挥着极其重要的作用。</p>
<p>\121. On the one hand, it is indisputable that boarding schools are exerting a growing important effect, especially in last few years.</p>
<p>一方面，寄宿学校正在发挥越来越重要的作用，尤其是最近几年，这是无可争辩的。</p>
<p>\122. Students attend a boarding school would cultivate their independence as apart from their parents.</p>
<p>离开父母上寄宿学校的学生将会培养他们的独立性。</p>
<p>\123. What's more, living in school can save them a great deal of time on the way between home and school everyday, so they would be able to concentrate more time and energy on their academic work.</p>
<p>而且，生活在学校里能节省大量每天往返于学校和家的路上的时间，这会使他们有更多的时间和精力放在学习上。</p>
<p>\124. On the other hand, the contribution of day schools can't be ignored.</p>
<p>另一方面，日制学校的贡献是不能忽视的。</p>
<p>\125. Due to high tuition fee, most of ordinary families cannot afford to send their children to boarding schools.</p>
<p>因为较高的学费，大部分普通家庭支付不起他们的孩子上寄宿学校的费用。</p>
<p>\126. Since it is unnecessary to consider student's routine life, day school can lay stress on teaching instead of other aspects, such as management of dormitory and cafeteria.</p>
<p>由于无需考虑学生的日常生活，日制学校可以将重点放在教学上而不是放在像宿舍和食堂管理这些方面。</p>
<p>\127. Furthermore, students living in their own home would have access to a comfortable life and have more opportunities to communicate with their parents, which have beneficial impact on development of their personal character.</p>
<p>而且，学生生活在自己家中，有舒适的生活，并有更多机会和父母交流，这对他们个性的培养是有利的。</p>
<p>\128. From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that both of day schools and boarding schools are important to train young students for our society.</p>
<p>通过以上讨论，我们可以得出结论，寄宿学校和日制学校对我们社会培养年轻学生都是重要的。</p>
<p>\129. There is much discussion over science and technology. One of the questions under debate is whether traditional technology and methods are bound to die out when a country begins to develop modern science and technology.</p>
<p>关于科学技术存在许多争论，其中一个问题是当国家发展现代科学技术时，传统的技术方法是否可能会消亡？</p>
<p>\130. As for me, the declining of traditional technology and methods is not a bad thing; it is the natural result of progress of society.</p>
<p>我认为，传统技术方法的消亡不一定是坏事，这是社会进步的自然结果。</p>
