<p>7 - you understand and make use of most lesser known language features, technologies, and associated internals. Ability to automate significant amounts of systems administration.</p>
<p>8 - deep understanding of corner cases, esoteric features, protocols and systems including “theory of operation”. Demonstrated ability to design, deploy and own very critical or large infrastructure, build accompanying automation.</p>
<p>9 - could have written the book about the subject area but didn’t; works with standards committees on defining new standards and methodologies.</p>
